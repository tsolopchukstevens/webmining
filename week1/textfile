Excellent phone and excellent service 
I am a business user who heavily depends on mobile service 
Good phone but bad service 
One of the worse phones I have ever had
I bought this phone a week ago
I am very disappointed with this device
This is a good phone with many good features
This is the worst phone i have ever owned
The phone was completely unworkable
The staff was not only completely unqualified to answer my question, but the phone itself lacks key features
The crappy phone stopped working two days after i bought it
The crappy thing stopped working two days after i bought it
